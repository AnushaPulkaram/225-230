        comparable to that those who were being educated on a “live” basis (Wilkes<br>
and Burnham, 1991). Therefore, we formed the following hypotheses:
        </div>
    <div class="margin">
        H1
: Student performance in TVI courses would be superior to “live” courses<br>
H2
: Students rate their TVI experiences as at least as effective as<br>
“live” instruction<br>
H3
: There would be no differences in TVI effectiveness between<br>
subject areas.

    <div class="heading"><b>Student Performance</b></div>
    <div class="margin">
        As shown in Table 1 below, TVI students received slightly lower average
        </div>
        <div>grades, 3.37 vs. 3.43 (calculated on a 4-point scale), as compared to the<br>
average grade received by the MBA student that participated in the “live”<br>
videotaped class. On the average, both the TVI and corresponding “live”<br>
students received the highest grades in the environment/law MBA classes and<br>
performed least well in economics courses. In performance, “live” students<br>
received significantly higher grades in environment/law, communications,<br>
MIS, management and marketing while, TVI students out-performed the<br>
corresponding “live” students in accounting classes. It was not possible to<br>
obtain the grades for the students whose classes were videotaped for CRC1,<br>
so that information is not listed in this table.</div><br>
    <div class="heading"><b>Student Course Evaluations</b></div>
    <div class="margin">The TVI students were asked to fill out a specially adapted student course</div>
    <div>evaluation form at the end of each course. The results of these evaluations<br>

    <div>The survey asked the students to use a 5-point Likert scale to indicate their<br>
agreement with a set of statements about the course that they had just taken<br>
(1 = Strongly Disagree to 5 = Strongly Agree).</div>
    <div class="margin">Table 2 shows the combined results of these three cohorts. On the</div>
    <div>average, TVI student responses indicated a general level of satisfaction with<br>
these courses. The “live” components of the courses were felt to be of greater<br>
value than those received via TVI. In general, the course content issues were<br>
more highly ranked than those associated with the technical issues involving<br>
the videotaping and viewing. By averaging the scores in each of the three<br>
categories by subject area, we were able to identify differences in delivery<br>
effectiveness. According to the TVI students, the delivery of their accounting<br>
classes were significantly superior while the delivery of the management and<br>
MIS courses were thought to be significantly inferior, as compared to the<br>
average TVI course. In each of the instructional areas, a direct comparison of<br>
the average scores indicated that the students felt that the “live” component<br>
of their MBA classes were delivered more effectively than were either the TVI<br>
course content or videotape components</div><br>

    <div class="margin">By capturing the responses to comparable questions asked in the</div>
    <div>course evaluations completed by the “live” students, and categorizing<br>
these responses in a similar manner, it was possible to compare the<br>
evaluations by the TVI students to the evaluations of the “live” students<br>
in three of the five cohorts. (University policies regarding the public use<br>
of this information made such a comparison impossible for the two other<br>
cohorts). As shown in Table 3, course delivery, as evidenced by course<br>
evaluations, generally improved for the TVI students over time. Further,<br>
the average scores for questions grouped into the three categories were<br>
statistically higher for the CRC2 and CRC3 cohorts as compared to the<br>
average responses of the GD1 cohort.</div>
    <div class="margin">Finally, comparing the average TVI student responses in each of these</div>
    <div>categories against the appropriate average student evaluation by “live”<br>
students during two academic terms, Fall 97 and Spring 98, showed that<br>
the TVI students, in general, found the quality of their “live” interactions<br>
superior to students whose entire MBA experience was conducted on a<br>
“live” basis. The analysis also showed that the content of the MBA courses<br>
offered on a TVI basis were judged as superior as well. However, the<br>
average of the three TVI cohort scores indicates that these students felt<br>
that the overall delivery of their instructors’ lectures was statistically<br>
inferior to those delivered “live.”</div><br><br>

evaluation was given for the attempt at equating the videotaped format with<br>

two GD cohorts, the only statistically significant improvement across pro-<br>grams occurred in the area of improved communications skills (question 4),<br>
while the GD2 cohort reported that they were less satisfied with the return on<br>
the company’s investment in the program (question 7) when compared to the<br>
responses of GD1.</div>

satisfied with the program. Specifically, they rated career development<br>
(question 1), communication skill development (question 4), ethical consid-<br>erations (question 5), technical skills (question 6), and the video format<br>
(question 10) more highly than did the students of CRC2. However, this GD<br>
cohort was less satisfied with their company’s investment in library resources<br>

        <div class="margin">Overall, the SOBAM faculty feel that their experiences with this distance</div>
        <div>teaching technology have been positive. The alumni of these programs are<br>
generally enthusiastic about their experiences. They believe their time and<br>
effort have paid off for them. They believe their companies have received<br>
good value for their investments in these programs.</div>
        <div class="margin">The opportunity to teach in this program was also highly valued by</div>
        <div>SOBAM faculty because it gave them the opportunity to travel to China and<br>
be exposed to foreign culture. The logistical demands of the taping also meant<br>
that many of their lectures were better prepared, and in some cases this left<br>
them with better organized material for subsequent “live” classes on the same<br>
topics. In addition, the University became much more aware of the<br>
demands of doing this type of training and now has much greater capabil-<br>ity to do it successfully.</div>
        <div class="margin">Contrary to expectations, the average grade for the TVI students was</div>
        <div>lower than the average grade for the students that attended the “live” classes<br>
taped for this program. This is also contrary to the findings of the earlier<br>
research studies.</div>

        <div class="margin">In retrospect, the faculty who taught in these programs have developed</div>
        <div>several hypotheses as to why program performances and student achieve-<br>ments differed from those expected. Few of the faculty used the tutor as<br>
intended. In the later cohorts in both programs, the role of the tutor was<br>
functionally downgraded to that of course assistant; e.g., starting the video,<br>
mailing the assignments, etc. Further, due to circumstances beyond the direct<br>
control of the SOBAM faculty, many of the students ended up watching<br>
videotapes individually (without the benefit of the group interaction and<br>
active questioning inherent in the TVI model). Specifically,</div>
        <ul>
        <li>The TVI was not used as designed because the client companies decided<br>
not to provide the required level of tutoring (for a majority of the courses<br>
that were offered) and would not enforce the group-oriented learning<br>
environment that is essential for effective TVI;</li>
        <li> Many of the SOBAM faculty were not fully aware of the underlying<br>
concepts of TVI, and the San Francisco-based program coordinators did<br>
not require that the TVI model be followed;</li>
        <li> Approximately one-third of the class contact hours “live”; and</li>
        <li> The TVI program did not take full advantage of the learning curve; i.e.,<br>
the experiences of the faculty teaching in the program were not captured,<br>
analyzed, organized, and presented to faculty who were teaching in the<br>
program for the first time.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="margin">To summarize, the version of the TVI technology that was actually used</div>
        <div>in China by SOBAM faculty should be more properly labeled “VI” than TVI<br>
because the students actually received a “video instruction,” devoid of any in-<br>class discussion. Modifications in the TVI program actually reduced the<br>
effectiveness of the technology.</div>
